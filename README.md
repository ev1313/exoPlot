# exoPlot

## Overview
exoPlot is consisted of two Python scripts. One plots positions of exoplanets on the sky based on given criteria, and the other plots effective flux received by planets, versus the effective stellar temperature. The development of exoPlot was largely based on [this paper](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-082214-122238).

Exoplanet data comes from [The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia](http://exoplanet.eu/).

## How to run
- clone or download this repo
- in command line, run `python exoPlot.py` to plot positions of exoplanets on the sky
- run `python exoPlot_habitable.py` to plot the flux vs. temperature diagram

## Examples
